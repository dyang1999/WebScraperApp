# Part II Scraping instructions

https://www.securityweek.com/threat-actor-abuses-microsoft%E2%80%99s-whcp-sign-malicious-drivers will be used as an example to demonstrate the app's functionalities.

2. Inspect orginal website for the tags containing text that you wish to scrape. 
- In this case, I wish to scrape the title "Threat Actor Abuses Microsoftâ€™s WHCP to Sign Malicious Drivers" which is located under the h2 tag, with a class, "page-title".       Input "h2" into the "tag name" row. Input "page-title" into the "CSS class" row (optional, it will be compulsory if the website has other instances of h2 tags cotaining       text)

- I wish to scrape the body of the article as well. Upon inspection , there are 2 components where test is found, the sypnosis in bold and the main body paragraphs. All of     which are encapsulated by different immediate tags, <span> and <p>s respectively. As such going up a level in the html markup language we see <div class="content clear-       block"> encapsualting both areas of interest. Therefore we key in "div" into the "tag name" row and "content clear-block" into the "css class" row.
